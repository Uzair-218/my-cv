    <h2>About the Crisis in Gaza</h2>
    <p>
      Gaza, a densely populated area home to over 2 million people, has been under siege for years. Basic necessities like clean water, electricity, and medical care are scarce. The ongoing conflict has devastated countless lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      In recent months, thousands of innocent civilians — many of them children — have been killed or displaced. This is a humanitarian tragedy, and silence is complicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must raise our voices for peace, for justice, and for freedom.
